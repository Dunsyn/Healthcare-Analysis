# Healthcare-Analysis
In today's fast-evolving world, data is not just an asset; it is the key to unlocking unparalleled efficiencies and transformative insights. 
As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I recently had the opportunity to analyze a healthcare dataset comprising patient demographics, treatment outcomes, admission insights, billing details, and hospital performance. 
This experience underscored the vital role of data-driven insights in shaping the future of healthcare delivery. 

*Project Overview*  
The analysis revolved around a comprehensive dataset containing information about 9,416 doctors, 8,639 hospitals, 10,000 admitted patients, and five insurance providers. The project's key objectives included:  
1. *Enhancing Patient Outcomes*: Identifying trends in patient demographics, conditions, and treatments.  
2. *Operational Efficiency*: Streamlining hospital operations by analyzing admission patterns, length of stay, and resource utilization.  
3. *Cost Analysis*: Unveiling insights into billing patterns and insurance coverage to improve financial performance.  

# *Data Transformation and Modeling*  
Data accuracy and consistency are critical in healthcare analytics. Our approach included:  
- *ETL Processes*: Standardizing data formats, handling missing data, and removing duplicates.  
- *Calculations and Transformations*: Determining the length of hospital stays and grouping patients by age categories for trend analysis.  
- *Data Schema Development*: Establishing relationships between tables for patient, doctor, and hospital data to ensure seamless querying.
  
*Technical Tools and Techniques* 
- SQL:  
   - Conducted operations such as joins, common table expressions (CTEs), and conditional aggregations.  
   - Window functions helped calculate running totals, averages, and ranking metrics.
     
- Microsoft Power Query:  
   - Automated transformations such as reformatting, renaming columns, and appending datasets.  

- Excel:  
   - Used as a staging tool for initial checks before loading data into SQL.  
   - Processed smaller datasets requiring minimal transformations.  

# *Key Insights Unveiled*  
1. *Patient Demographics*:  
   - Female patients outnumbered males, with elderly individuals (65â€“85 years) forming the largest demographic group.  
   - Chronic conditions such as asthma and cancer were prevalent, with cancer being more common in females and asthma more frequent in males.  

2. *Admission Insights*:  
   - Urgent admissions were most prevalent, with significant spikes during the pandemic.  
   - Hypertension was the most common condition requiring urgent care, while arthritis resulted in the longest average hospital stays.  

3. *Billing and Cost Analysis*:  
   - Treatments for diabetes and obesity were the costliest, while arthritis incurred the least expenses.  
   - Aetna provided the highest-cost coverage, whereas Medicare was the most cost-effective insurer.  

4. *Treatment Outcomes*:  
   - Medications like Aspirin (for asthma) and Ibuprofen (for cancer) showed condition-specific efficacy, guiding future prescription strategies.  

5. *Hospital Performance*:  
   - Smith PLC stood out with the highest capacity for patient admissions, while Arellano-Mahoney Hospital had the highest average billing amount.  

# *Recommendations for Stakeholders*  
Based on these findings, several actionable steps were proposed:  
- *Proactive Outreach*: Develop preventive programs for high-risk groups, focusing on asthma and cancer to reduce emergency admissions.  
- *Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms*: Implement patient surveys and interviews to continuously improve service quality.  
- *Strategic Cost Management*: Negotiate favorable terms with insurers and explore cost-effective medication options.  
- *Invest in Innovation*: Equip hospitals with advanced diagnostic tools and specialized training to improve treatment outcomes.
